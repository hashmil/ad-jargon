# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Common questions about the Ad Agency Jargon Translator project.

## üé≠ About the Project

### What is the Ad Agency Jargon Translator?
A satirical web application that transforms normal business language into hilariously over-the-top advertising agency buzzwords. It's designed to parody the ridiculous, impenetrable language often used in corporate environments.

### Is this a serious business tool?
Not at all! This is pure satire designed to bring humour to the corporate world. While it does work as advertised (transforming text into jargon), its primary purpose is entertainment and gentle mockery of buzzword culture.

### Who is the target audience?
Anyone who has ever been in a corporate meeting and rolled their eyes at buzzword bingo. Marketing professionals, agency workers, and anyone familiar with corporate speak will appreciate the humour.

### Why British English?
The project uses British English throughout (optimise, colour, realise) for consistency and to differentiate from American corporate speak. It's also a nod to the international nature of the advertising industry.

## üîß Technical Questions

### What technologies power this application?
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4 with custom gradients
- **AI**: OpenRouter API with Mistral Small 3.2 24B model
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages with Edge Runtime
- **Fallback**: Rule-based translation system

### Why use OpenRouter instead of OpenAI directly?
- **Cost**: Free tier with generous limits
- **Multiple Models**: Access to various AI models through one API
- **Reliability**: Good uptime and performance
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch models if needed

### What happens if the AI is unavailable?
The application has a robust fallback system that uses rule-based translation. It will always provide a jargon translation even if the AI service is down, ensuring 100% uptime for core functionality.

### How does the fallback system work?
It uses:
1. **Predefined mappings**: 40+ common business terms to jargon equivalents
2. **Buzzword injection**: Random corporate buzzwords added throughout
3. **Template phrases**: Agency-style prefixes and suffixes
4. **British spelling**: Consistent with the overall application

### Is my data stored anywhere?
No! The application is completely stateless:
- Your input text is processed and immediately discarded
- No user data is stored in databases
- No tracking beyond basic analytics
- Each translation request is independent

## üöÄ Usage Questions

### How accurate are the translations?
"Accuracy" is subjective for satirical content! The AI translations are creative and contextual, while the fallback system is more predictable but reliable. Both aim to be entertainingly over-the-top rather than "accurate."

### Can I use this for actual business communications?
Please don't! While the output is grammatically correct, it's intentionally ridiculous and may confuse or alienate your audience. Use it for humour, training examples, or understanding how corporate jargon works.

### What's the character limit for input?
There's no hard limit enforced, but:
- **Recommended**: Under 500 characters for best results
- **AI Model**: Has a context window, very long inputs may be truncated
- **Performance**: Shorter inputs translate faster

### Why does the same input sometimes produce different outputs?
- **AI Translation**: Uses temperature=0.8 for creativity, so outputs vary
- **Fallback System**: Includes randomness in buzzword injection
- **Different Methods**: AI vs fallback will produce different styles

### Can I translate non-English text?
The system is designed for English business language. Other languages may produce unexpected results or fail to translate properly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Questions

### Can I contribute to the project?
Absolutely! The project welcomes contributions:
- **Bug reports**: Report issues on GitHub
- **Feature requests**: Suggest improvements
- **Code contributions**: Submit pull requests
- **Documentation**: Help improve guides and docs

### How do I add my own jargon mappings?
Edit `lib/translator.ts`:

```typescript
export const jargonMap: JargonMap = {
  // Add your mappings here
  'your-term': 'synergistic replacement',
  'another-word': 'paradigm-shifting alternative',
  // ... existing mappings
};
```

### Can I use a different AI model?
Yes! Edit `app/api/translate/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Change the model
model: "anthropic/claude-3-haiku"
// or
model: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

Note: Different models may have different pricing and capabilities.

### How do I deploy to other platforms?
The application works on any platform supporting Next.js:
- **Vercel**: Native Next.js support
- **Netlify**: Use Next.js adapter

### Why Edge Runtime instead of Node.js runtime?
Edge Runtime provides:
- **Global performance**: Runs close to users worldwide
- **Fast cold starts**: <50ms initialization
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay per request, not server time
- **Auto-scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### The translation isn't working, what should I check?
1. **Check the fallback**: Does rule-based translation work?
2. **Verify API key**: Is your OpenRouter key valid?
3. **Network issues**: Can you reach openrouter.ai?
4. **Console errors**: Any JavaScript errors in browser?

### Why am I getting American spellings?
- **AI model**: May default to American English despite prompts
- **Fallback mappings**: Check if all use British spellings
- **Input text**: American spellings in input may influence output

### The site is slow, how can I speed it up?
- **CDN**: Cloudflare provides global caching
- **AI response**: Can take 2-5 seconds (normal)
- **Fallback**: Should be <100ms response time
- **Network**: Check your internet connection

### Common error messages and solutions:
- **"Text is required"**: Ensure you've entered text before translating
- **"Translation failed"**: Try again, fallback should still work
- **"Network error"**: Check internet connection
- **"Rate limited"**: Wait a moment and try again
