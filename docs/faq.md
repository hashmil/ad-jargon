# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Common questions about the Ad Agency Jargon Translator project.

## üé≠ About the Project

### What is the Ad Agency Jargon Translator?
A satirical web application that transforms normal business language into hilariously over-the-top advertising agency buzzwords. It's designed to parody the ridiculous, impenetrable language often used in corporate environments.

### Is this a serious business tool?
Not at all! This is pure satire designed to bring humour to the corporate world. While it does work as advertised (transforming text into jargon), its primary purpose is entertainment and gentle mockery of buzzword culture.

### Who is the target audience?
Anyone who has ever been in a corporate meeting and rolled their eyes at buzzword bingo. Marketing professionals, agency workers, and anyone familiar with corporate speak will appreciate the humour.

### Why British English?
The project uses British English throughout (optimise, colour, realise) for consistency and to differentiate from American corporate speak. It's also a nod to the international nature of the advertising industry.

## üîß Technical Questions

### What technologies power this application?
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4 with custom gradients
- **AI**: OpenRouter API with Mistral Small 3.2 24B model
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages with Edge Runtime
- **Reliability**: Retry logic with up to 2 attempts for failed requests

### Why use OpenRouter instead of OpenAI directly?
- **Cost**: Free tier with generous limits
- **Multiple Models**: Access to various AI models through one API
- **Reliability**: Good uptime and performance
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch models if needed

### What happens if the AI is unavailable?
The application uses retry logic to handle temporary failures. If the initial request fails, it will automatically retry up to 2 times. If all attempts fail, the user will receive an error message and can try again manually.

### How does the retry system work?
The application implements:
1. **Automatic retries**: Up to 2 additional attempts for failed requests
2. **Exponential backoff**: Brief delays between retry attempts
3. **Error handling**: Clear error messages when all attempts fail
4. **Manual retry**: Users can simply click translate again

### Is my data stored anywhere?
No! The application is completely stateless:
- Your input text is processed and immediately discarded
- No user data is stored in databases
- No tracking beyond basic analytics
- Each translation request is independent

## üöÄ Usage Questions

### How accurate are the translations?
"Accuracy" is subjective for satirical content! The AI translations are creative and contextual, aiming to be entertainingly over-the-top rather than "accurate." The AI model provides sophisticated understanding of business language and corporate culture.

### Can I use this for actual business communications?
Please don't! While the output is grammatically correct, it's intentionally ridiculous and may confuse or alienate your audience. Use it for humour, training examples, or understanding how corporate jargon works.

### What's the character limit for input?
There's no hard limit enforced, but:
- **Recommended**: Under 500 characters for best results
- **AI Model**: Has a context window, very long inputs may be truncated
- **Performance**: Shorter inputs translate faster

### Why does the same input sometimes produce different outputs?
- **AI Creativity**: Uses temperature=0.8 for creative variation in outputs
- **Model Behaviour**: AI models naturally produce slightly different results
- **Contextual Understanding**: The AI considers subtle nuances in phrasing

### Can I translate non-English text?
The system is designed for English business language. Other languages may produce unexpected results or fail to translate properly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Questions

### Can I contribute to the project?
Absolutely! The project welcomes contributions:
- **Bug reports**: Report issues on GitHub
- **Feature requests**: Suggest improvements
- **Code contributions**: Submit pull requests
- **Documentation**: Help improve guides and docs

### How do I customize the AI translation behaviour?
Edit the prompt in `app/api/translate/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Modify the system prompt to adjust translation style
const prompt = `Your customized instructions for the AI model...`;
```

### Can I use a different AI model?
Yes! Edit `app/api/translate/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Change the model
model: "anthropic/claude-3-haiku"
// or
model: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

Note: Different models may have different pricing and capabilities.

### How do I deploy to other platforms?
The application works on any platform supporting Next.js:
- **Vercel**: Native Next.js support
- **Netlify**: Use Next.js adapter
- **Railway**: Docker or buildpack deployment
- **Self-hosted**: Standard Node.js server

### Why Edge Runtime instead of Node.js runtime?
Edge Runtime provides:
- **Global performance**: Runs close to users worldwide
- **Fast cold starts**: <50ms initialization
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay per request, not server time
- **Auto-scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically

- **Fork the project**: Create your own version
- **NPM package**: Could be packaged for easy integration

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### The translation isn't working, what should I check?
1. **Verify API key**: Is your OpenRouter key valid and active?
2. **Network issues**: Can you reach openrouter.ai?
3. **Rate limits**: Have you exceeded the API rate limits?
4. **Console errors**: Any JavaScript errors in browser?
5. **Retry**: Try the translation again as retry logic may resolve temporary issues

### Why am I getting American spellings?
- **AI model**: May default to American English despite prompts
- **Prompt refinement**: Adjust system prompts to emphasize British spellings
- **Input text**: American spellings in input may influence output
- **Model training**: AI models may have bias toward American English

### The site is slow, how can I speed it up?
- **CDN**: Cloudflare provides global caching
- **AI response**: Can take 2-5 seconds (normal for AI processing)
- **Retry delays**: Retry logic may add slight delays for failed requests
- **Network**: Check your internet connection and API response times

### Common error messages and solutions:
- **"Text is required"**: Ensure you've entered text before translating
- **"Translation failed"**: Try again, retry logic will attempt up to 2 more times
- **"Network error"**: Check internet connection to OpenRouter API
- **"Rate limited"**: Wait a moment and try again, or check your API usage limits
- **"API key invalid"**: Verify your OpenRouter API key is correct and active
